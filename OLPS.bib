  Abstract                 = {A universalization of a parameterized investment strategy is an online algorithm whose average daily performance approaches that of the strategy operating with the optimal param- eters determined online in hindsight. We present a general framework for universalizing investment strategies and discuss conditions under which investment strategies are universalizable. We present examples of common investment strategies that ﬁt into our framework. The examples include both trading strategies that decide positions in individual stocks, and portfolio strategies that allocate wealth among multiple stocks. This work extends in a natural way Cover’s universal portfolio work. We also discuss the runtime efficiency of universalization algorithms. While a straightforward im- plementation of our algorithms runs in time exponential in the number of parameters, we show that the efficient universal portfolio computation technique of Kalai and Vempala [Proceedings of the 41st Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, Redondo Beach, CA, 2000, pp. 486–491] involving the sampling of log-concave functions can be generalized to other classes of investment strategies, thus yielding provably good approximation algorithms in our framework.},

  Abstract                 = {Competitive analysis is concerned with minimizing a relative measure of performance. When applied to financial trading strategies, competitive analysis leads to the development of strategies with minimum relative performance risk. This approach is too inflexible. Many investors are interested in managing their risk: they may be willing to increase their risk for some form of reward. They may also have some forecast of the future. In this paper, we extend competitive analysis to provide a framework in which investors can develop optimal trading strategies based on their risk tolerance and forecast.We first define notions of risk and reward that are smooth extensions of classical competitive analysis. We then illustrate our ideas using the ski-rental problem. Finally, we analyze a financial game, the unidirectional conversion problem. In particular, we present an optimal risk-tolerant algorithm for the forecast that prices will reach a certain level at some point during the game, and give numerical results of the investor's reward for making such a forecast.},

  Abstract                 = {Cover's universal portfolio has deep connections to universal data compression. In this paper, we provide a statistical view of universal portfolios in order to develop a clearer understanding of their performance on actual financial data sequences. By recasting the analysis of a universal portfolio in statistical terms - with a special emphasis on means and covariances - we are able to resolve a long standing and false perception of a disconnect between information theory and empirical finance. We first show that the universal portfolio can be characterized as a conditional expectation of a multivariate normal random variable. We then show that this implies that the universal portfolio algorithm is asymptotically approximately equal to a constrained sequential Markowitz mean-variance portfolio optimization based on estimates of the mean of a multivariate normal distribution. In light of this equivalence, we propose alternative estimation methods and conclude with some practical investment advice},

  Abstract                 = {A constant rebalanced portfolio is an investment strategy which keeps the same distribution of wealth among a set of stocks from period to period. Recently there has been work on on-line investment strategies that are competitive with the best constant rebalanced portfolio determined in hindsight (Cover, 1991, 1996; Helmbold et al., 1996; Cover & Ordentlich, 1996a, 1996b; Ordentlich & Cover, 1996). For the universal algorithm of Cover (Cover, 1991),we provide a simple analysis which naturallyextends to the case of a fixed percentage transaction cost (commission ), answering a question raised in (Cover, 1991; Helmbold et al., 1996; Cover & Ordentlich, 1996a, 1996b; Ordentlich & Cover, 1996; Cover, 1996). In addition, we present a simple randomized implementation that is significantly faster in practice. We conclude by explaining how these algorithms can be applied to other problems, such as combining the predictions of statistical language models, where the resulting guarantees are more striking.},

  Abstract                 = {Given a set of say m stocks (one of which may be “cash”), the online portfolio selection problem is to determine a portfolio for the i th trading period based on the sequence of prices for the preceding i – 1 trading periods. Competitive analysis is based on a worst case perspective and such a perspective is inconsistent with the more widely accepted analyses and theories based on distributional assumptions. The competitive framework does (perhaps surprisingly) permit non trivial upper bounds on relative performance against CBAL-OPT, an optimal offline constant rebalancing portfolio. Perhaps more impressive are some preliminary experimental results showing that certain algorithms that enjoy “respectable” competitive (i.e. worst case) performance also seem to perform quite well on historical sequences of data. These algorithms and the emerging competitive theory are directly related to studies in information theory and computational learning theory and indeed some of these algorithms have been pioneered within the information theory and computational learning communities. We present a mixture of both theoretical and experimental results, including a more detalied study of the performance of existing and new algorithms with respect to a standard sequence of historical data cited in many studies. We also present experiments from two other historical data sequences.},

Our empirical results on historical markets provide strong evidence that this type of technical trading can ``beat the market'' and moreover, can beat the best stock in the market. In doing so we utilize a new idea for smoothing critical parameters in the context of expert learning.},

Recently, a systematic study of performance measures for online algorithms was initiated [J. Boyar, S. Irani, K.S. Larsen, A comparison of performance measures for online algorithms, in: Eleventh International Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium, in: Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 5664, Springer, 2009, pp. 119–130], first focusing on a simple server problem. We continue this work by studying a fundamentally different online problem, online search, and the Reservation Price Policies in particular. The purpose of this line of work is to learn more about the applicability of various performance measures in different situations and the properties that the different measures emphasize. We investigate the following analysis techniques: Competitive, Relative Worst Order, Bijective, Average, Relative Interval, Random Order, and Max/Max. In addition, we have established the first optimality proof for Relative Interval Analysis. },

It can be shown that Sn * exceeds the best stock, the Dow Jones average, and the value line index at time n. In fact, Sn* usually exceeds these quantities by an exponential factor. Let x1, x2, be an arbitrary sequence of market vectors. It will be shown that the nonanticipating sequence of portfolios db yields wealth such that , for every bounded sequence x1, x2…, and, under mild conditions, achievewhere J, is an (m - 1) x (m - I) sensitivity matrix. Thus this portfolio strategy has the same exponential rate of growth as the apparently unachievable S*n.},

In fact, this sequential portfolio performs as well (up to first order terms in the exponent) as the optimal portfolio based on advance knowledge of the n-period empirical distribution of the market. Moreover, to first order in the exponent, the capital resulting from this portfolio will be no less than the best of the available stocks. This is a result that holds for every sample sequence. Thus bull markets and bear markets can not fool the investor into over-committing or under-committing his capital to the risky alternatives available to him. The goal is accomplished by a choice of portfolio which is robust with respect to futures that may differ drastically from the past. },

Specifically the algorithm tracks the best in hindsight wealth achievable within target classes of linearly parameterized portfolio sequences. The target classes considered are more general than the standard constant rebalanced portfolio class and permit portfolio sequences to exhibit a continuous form of dependence on past prices or other side information. A primary advantage of the algorithm is that it is easily computable in a polynomial number of steps by way of simple closed-form expressions. This provides an edge over other universal algorithms that require both an exponential number of computations and numerical approximation.},

Of the 14 models we evaluate across seven empirical datasets, none is consistently better than the 1/N rule in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, or turnover, which indicates that, out of sample, the gain from optimal diversification is more than offset by estimation error. Based on parameters calibrated to the US equity market, our analytical results and simulations show that the estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy and its extensions to outperform the 1/N benchmark is around 3000 months for a portfolio with 25 assets and about 6000 months for a portfolio with 50 assets. This suggests that there are still many “miles to go” before the gains promised by optimal portfolio choice can actually be realized out of sample.},

  Abstract                 = {Although expected utility theory and the classical mean-variance diversification theory of Markowitz assert that optimal diversification depends on the joint distribution of returns, investors tend to ignore these well-accepted theoretical approaches in favor of the naive investment strategy promulgated in the Babylonian Talmud called the 1/3 rule (or the 1/n rule for n assets), which assigns an equal weight to each security in the portfolio. In testing the efficiency of the 1/n rule, the authors find that it outperforms the mean-variance rule for individual small portfolios out of sample, but for large portfolios (i.e., institutional investors) the Markowitz strategy is superior .The advantage of the 1/n rule in the out-of-sample analysis is the absence of exposures to estimation errors.

The on-line line players a priori information about the fluctuation of exchange rates distinguishes different variants of the problem. For three variants they show that a simple threat-based strategy is optimal for the on-line player and determine its competitive ratio.

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the time series search and one-way trading problems. In the (time series) search problem a player is searching for the maximum (or minimum) price in a sequence that unfolds sequentially, one price at a time. Once during this game the player can decide to accept the current price p in which case the game ends and the player's payoff is p . In the one-way trading problem a trader is given the task of trading dollars to yen. Each day, a new exchange rate is announced and the trader must decide how many dollars to convert to yen according to the current rate. The game ends when the trader trades his entire dollar wealth to yen and his payoff is the number of yen acquired. The search and one-way trading are intimately related. Any (deterministic or randomized) one-way trading algorithm can be viewed as a randomized search algorithm. Using the competitive ratio as a performance measure we determine the optimal competitive performance for several variants of these problems. In particular, we show that a simple threat-based strategy is optimal and we determine its competitive ratio which yields, for realistic values of the problem parameters, surprisingly low competitive ratios. We also consider and analyze a one-way trading game played against an adversary called Nature where the online player knows the probability distribution of the maximum exchange rate and that distribution has been chosen by Nature.

We measure the economic value of this “realized” volatility approach in the context of investment decisions. Our results indicate that the value of switching from daily to intradaily returns to estimate the conditional covariance matrix can be substantial. We estimate that a risk-averse investor would be willing to pay 50 to 200 basis points per year to capture the observed gains in portfolio performance. Moreover, these gains are robust to transaction costs, estimation risk regarding expected returns, and the performance measurement horizon. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper is dedicated to the problem of dynamic portfolio optimization for the case when the number of decision periods is large and new information about market arrives during each such period. We propose the family of adaptive portfolio selection policies which rebalance the current portfolio during each decision period by adopting portfolio from a specified family with the best performance on the past data. In the absence of transaction costs the general conditions are found under which this policy yields asymptotically the same performance as the best portfolio from the same family constructed with the full knowledge of the future. These results are extended for the case of nonzero transaction costs by introducing a class of threshold portfolio optimization policies which rebalance current portfolio only when its performance differs from performance of the best portfolio by a given threshold. The value of this threshold is adapted to the changing market conditions. We show that it is possible to select a sequence of threshold values in such a way that the asymptotic influence of transaction costs on portfolio performance is negligible and overall portfolio performance is asymptotically the same as the performance of portfolio with the perfect knowledge of the future. We do not assume neither specific probabilistic structure of the market data nor their stationarity. Our theory is illustrated by numerical experiments with real data. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results in the context of high performance computing. },

The antiocr algorithm only exploits the property of “reversal to the mean” and its performance not only significantly depends on the size of window but also fluctuates wildly according to the different size of window. To overcome these limitations, this proposed algorithm is designed to deal with the portfolio selection problem by fully exploiting both the price momentum and the price reversal in Chinese stock markets. Equipped with several parameters, the proposed mean reversion strategy can better track the changing stock market. Extensive experiments on real stock data from Chinese markets demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategies in comparison with the anticor algorithm without knowledge of the investment duration.},

We characterize the multiple priors by a “confidence interval” around the estimated expected returns and we model ambiguity aversion via a minimization over the priors. Our model has several attractive features: (1) it has a solid axiomatic foundation; (2) it is flexible enough to allow for different degrees of uncertainty about expected returns for various subsets of assets and also about the return-generating model; and (3) it delivers closed-form expressions for the optimal portfolio. Our empirical analysis suggests that, compared with portfolios from classical and Bayesian models, ambiguity-averse portfolios are more stable over time and deliver a higher out-of sample Sharpe ratio.

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel efficient algorithm for portfolio selection which theoretically attains two desirable properties: * 1Worst-case guarantee: the algorithm is universal in the sense that it asymptotically performs almost as well as the best constant rebalanced portfolio determined in hindsight from the realized market prices. Furthermore, it attains the tightest known bounds on the regret, or the log-wealth difference relative to the best constant rebalanced portfolio. We prove that the regret of algorithm is bounded by O(log Q), where Q is the quadratic variation of the stock prices. This is the first improvement upon Cover’s (1991) seminal work that attains a regret bound of O(log T), where T is the number of trading iterations. * 2Average-case guarantee: in the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model of stock prices, our algorithm attains tighter regret bounds, which are provably impossible in the worst-case. Hence, when the GBM model is a good approximation of the behavior of market, the new algorithm has an advantage over previous ones, albeit retaining worst-case guarantees.

  Abstract                 = {We present an on-line investment algorithm that achieves almost the same wealth as the best constant-rebalanced portfolio determined in hindsight from the actual market outcomes. The algorithm employs a multiplicative update rule derived using a framework introduced by Kivinen and Warmuth. Our algorithm is very simple to implement and requires only constant storage and computing time per stock in each trading period. We tested the performance of our algorithm on real stock data from the New York Stock Exchange accumulated during a 22-year period. On these data, our algorithm clearly outperforms the best single stock as well as Cover's universal portfolio selection algorithm. We also present results for the situation in which the investor has access to additional “side information.”},

In that case, imposing no-short-sale constraints should hurt, whereas empirical evidence is often to the contrary. We reconcile this apparent contradiction. We explain why constraining portfolio weights to be nonnegative can reduce the risk in estimated optimal portfolios even when the constraints are wrong. Surprisingly, with no-short-sale constraints in place, the sample covariance matrix performs as well as covariance matrix estimates based on factor models, shrinkage estimators, and daily data.},

A Markowitz efficient portfolio is the vector of weights X m that minimizes the variance σ m 2 of the total return from the portfolio, subject to the condition that the portfolio mean premium return μ m has a certain value. The estimators for the N × 1 vector X m , the return premium μ m , and the variable σ m 2 require estimators for the mean premium return vector and for the covariance matrix Σ. The expectations, variances, and asymptotic distributions of the estimators of X m , μ m , and σ m 2 are derived under the assumption that returns are normally distributed. The use of these sampling properties for statistical inference is also discussed. The derived results are also compared with results obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation for a population of 20 stocks and several sample sizes. },

The resulting loss in the investor's utility is a function of the particular estimator chosen for expected returns. So, this is a problem of simultaneous estimation of normal means under a well-specified loss function. In this situation, as Stein has shown, the classical sample mean is inadmissible. This paper presents a simple empirical Bayes estimator that should outperform the sample mean in the context of a portfolio. Simulation analysis shows that these Bayes-Stein estimators provide significant gains in portfolio selection problems.},

  Abstract                 = {In an online decision problem, one makes a sequence of decisions without knowledge of the future. Each period, one pays a cost based on the decision and observed state. We give a simple approach for doing nearly as well as the best single decision, where the best is chosen with the benefit of hindsight. A natural idea is to follow the leader, i.e. each period choose the decision which has done best so far. We show that by slightly perturbing the totals and then choosing the best decision, the expected performance is nearly as good as the best decision in hindsight. Our approach, which is very much like Hannan's original game-theoretic approach from the 1950s, yields guarantees competitive with the more modern exponential weighting algorithms like Weighted Majority. More importantly, these follow-the-leader style algorithms extend naturally to a large class of structured online problems for which the exponential algorithms are inefficient. },

  Abstract                 = {A constant rebalanced portfolio is an investment strategy that keeps the same distribution of wealth among a set of stocks from day to day. There has been much work on Cover's Universal algorithm, which is competitive with the best constant rebalanced portfolio determined in hindsight (Cover, 1991, Helmbold et al, 1998, Blum and Kalai, 1999, Foster and Vohra, 1999, Vovk, 1998, Cover and Ordentlich, 1996a, Cover, 1996c). While this algorithm has good performance guarantees, all known implementations are exponential in the number of stocks, restricting the number of stocks used in experiments (Helmbold et al, 1998, Cover and Ordentlich, 1996a, Ordentlich and Cover, 1996b, Cover, 1996c, Blum and Kalai, 1999). We present an efficient implementation of the Universal algorithm that is based on non-uniform random walks that are rapidly mixing (Applegate and Kannan, 1991, Lovasz and Simonovits, 1992, Frieze and Kannan, 1999). This same implementation also works for non-financial applications of the Universal algorithm, such as data compression (Cover, 1996c) and language modeling (Chen et al, 1999).},

Our analytical results show that the standard plug-in approach that replaces the population parameters by their sample estimates can lead to very poor out-of-sample performance. We further show that with parameter uncertainty, holding the sample tangency portfolio and the riskless asset is never optimal. An investor can benefit by holding some other risky portfolios that help reduce the estimation risk. In particular, we show that a portfolio that optimally combines the riskless asset, the sample tangency portfolio, and the sample global minimum-variance portfolio dominates a portfolio with just the riskless asset and the sample tangency portfolio, suggesting that the presence of estimation risk completely alters the theoretical recommendation of a two-fund portfolio.},

On-line algorithms arise in any situation where decisions must be made and resources allocated without knowledge of the future. The effectiveness of an on-line algorithm may be measured by its competitive ratio, defined as the worst-case ratio between its cost and that of a hypothetical off-line algorithm which knows the entire sequence of requests in advance and chooses its actions optimally. In a variety of settings, we discuss techniques for proving upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratios achievable by on-line algorithms.

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT DeMiguel, Garlappi, and Uppal (2009) report that naïve diversification dominates mean-variance optimization in out-of-sample asset allocation tests. Our analysis suggests that this is largely due to their research design, which focuses on portfolios that are subject to high estimation risk and extreme turnover. We find that mean-variance optimization often outperforms naïve diversification, but turnover can erode its advantage in the presence of transaction costs. To address this issue, we develop 2 new methods of mean-variance portfolio selection (volatility timing and reward-to-risk timing) that deliver portfolios characterized by low turnover. These timing strategies outperform naïve diversification even in the presence of high transaction costs.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper determines the effect of estimation risk on optimal portfolio choice under uncertainty. In most realistic problems, the parameters of return distributions are unknown and are estimated using available economic data. Traditional analysis neglects estimation risk by treating the estimated parameters as if they were the true parameters to determine the optimal choice under uncertainty. We show that for normally distributed returns and ‘non-informative’ or ‘invariant’ priors, the admissible set of portfolios taking the estimation uncertainty into account is identical to that given by traditional analysis. However, as a result of estimation risk, the optimal portfolio choice differs from that obtained by traditional analysis. For other plausible priors, the admissible set, and consequently the optimal choice, is shown to differ from that in traditional analysis. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we investigate investment strategies that can rebalance their target portfolio vectors at arbitrary investment periods. These strategies are called semiconstant rebalanced portfolios in Blum and Kalai and Helmbold et al. Unlike a constant rebalanced portfolio, which must rebalance at every investment interval, a semiconstant rebalanced portfolio rebalances its portfolio only on selected instants. Hence, a semiconstant rebalanced portfolio may avoid rebalancing if the transaction costs outweigh the benefits of rebalancing. In a competitive algorithm framework, we compete against all such semiconstant portfolios with an arbitrary number of rebalancings and corresponding rebalancing instants. We investigate this framework with and without transaction costs and demonstrate sequential portfolios that asymptotically achieve the wealth of the best semiconstant rebalanced portfolios whose number of rebalancings and instants of rebalancings are tuned to the individual sequence of price relatives.},

It contains estimation error of the kind most likely to perturb a mean-variance optimizer. In its place, we suggest using the matrix obtained from the sample covariance matrix through a transformation called shrinkage. This tends to pull the most extreme coefficients towards more central values, thereby systematically reducing estimation error where it matters most. Statistically, the challenge is to know the optimal shrinkage intensity, and we give the formula for that. Without changing any other step in the portfolio optimization process, we show on actual stock market data that shrinkage reduces tracking error relative to a benchmark index, and substantially increases the realized information ratio of the active portfolio manager.},

  Abstract                 = {Online portfolio selection is a fundamental problem in computational finance, which has been extensively studied across several research communities, including finance, statistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data mining. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of online portfolio selection techniques published in the literature. From an online machine learning perspective, we first formulate online portfolio selection as a sequential decision problem, and then we survey a variety of state-of-the-art approaches, which are grouped into several major categories, including benchmarks, Follow-the-Winner approaches, Follow-the-Loser approaches, Pattern-Matching--based approaches, and Meta-Learning Algorithms. In addition to the problem formulation and related algorithms, we also discuss the relationship of these algorithms with the capital growth theory so as to better understand the similarities and differences of their underlying trading ideas. This article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive survey for both machine learning and data mining researchers in academia and quantitative portfolio managers in the financial industry to help them understand the state of the art and facilitate their research and practical applications. We also discuss some open issues and evaluate some emerging new trends for future research.},

Exploiting this phenomenon leads to expected return estimates that are more stable and precise than estimates delivered by standard methods. Portfolio selection can also be improved. At an extreme, optimal portfolio weights are proportional to expected returns when no factors are observable. We find that such portfolios perform well in simulations and in out-of-sample comparisons.},

We show that the maximum value of this ratio over all nonanticipating investment strategies is <tex-math>$V_{n}=[\Sigma \ 2^{-nH(n_{1}/n,\ldots ,n_{m}/n)}(n!/(n_{1}!\cdots n_{m}!))]^{-1}$</tex-math>, where H(·) is the Shannon entropy, and we specify a strategy achieving it. The optimal ratio V<sub>n</sub> is shown to decrease only polynomially in n, indicating that the rate of return of the optimal strategy converges uniformly to that of the best constant rebalanced portfolio determined with full hindsight. We also relate this result to the pricing of a new derivative security which might be called the hindsight allocation option.},

  Abstract                 = {The modern portfolio theory pioneered by Markowitz (1952) is widely used in practice and extensively taught to MBAs. However, the estimated Markowitz portfolio rule and most of its extensions not only underperform the naive 1/N rule (that invests equally across N assets) in simulations, but also lose money on a risk-adjusted basis in many real data sets. In this paper, we propose an optimal combination of the naive 1/N rule with one of the four sophisticated strategies—the Markowitz rule, the Jorion (1986) rule, the MacKinlay and Pástor (2000) rule, and the Kan and Zhou (2007) rule—as a way to improve performance. We find that the combined rules not only have a significant impact in improving the sophisticated strategies, but also outperform the 1/N rule in most scenarios. Since the combinations are theory-based, our study may be interpreted as reaffirming the usefulness of the Markowitz theory in practice.},

  Abstract                 = {A typical problem in portfolio selection in stock markets is that it is not clear which of the many available strategies should be used. We apply a general algorithm of prediction with expert advice (the Aggregating Algorithm) to two different idealizations of the stock mar- ket. One is the well-known game introduced by Cover in connection with his “universal port- folio” algorithm; the other is a more realis- tic modification of Cover’s game introduced in this paper, where market’s participants are al- lowed to take “short positions”, so that the algorithm may be applied to currency and fu- tures markets. Besides applying the Aggregat- ing Algorithm to a countable (or finite) family of arbitrary investment strategies, we also ap- ply it, in the case of Cover’s game, to the un- countable family of “constant rebalanced port- folios” considered by Cover. We generalize Cover’s worst-case bounds for his “universal portfolio” algorithm (which can be regarded as a special case of the Aggregating Algorithm corresponding to learning rate 1) to the case of learning rates not exceeding 1. Finally, we discuss a general approach to designing in- vestment strategies in which, instead of mak- ing statistical or other assumptions about the market, natural assumptions of computability are made about possible investment strategies; this approach leads to natural extensions of the notion of Kolmogorov complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {On-line portfolio is a sequential investment algorithm during a long period and makes portfolio decision without any statistical assumption about the behavior of the market. A constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP) is an investment strategy which adopts the same portfolio vector on each trading period. Design of on-line portfolio algorithms which are competitive with the best constant rebalanced portfolio (BCRP) is a hot topic recently. In this paper, we present a new on-line portfolio selection strategy, which computes the new portfolio vector based completely on on-line learning of linear functions. The proposed algorithm is useful since it gives the investor a whole range of choices for the on-line portfolios. Using the technique of taking relative entropy as a distance function, we prove that the new algorithm is a universal portfolio, which exhibits the same asymptotic growth rate in normalized natural logarithmic wealth as the \{BCRP\} for any sequence of price relatives. Experiments on several New York Stock Exchange dates also show the good performance of the new strategy. },
