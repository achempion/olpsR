\description{
computes the Anticor algorithm by Borodin et al. 2004
}
\details{
The idea of \code{Anticor} is to exploit the mean-reversion property
of asset prices. Based on two consecutive market windows of size \code{w}
wealth is transferred from asset i to asset j if the growth rate of asset i
is greater than the growth rate of asset j in the most recent window.
Additionally, the correlation between asset i in the second last window
and asset j in the last window must to be positive. The amount of wealth
transferred from asset i to j depends on the strength of correlation between
the assets and the strength of "self-anti-correlations" between each asset i.

The print method for \code{OLP} objects prints only a short summary.
