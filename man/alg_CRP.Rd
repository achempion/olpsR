\title{Constant Rebalanced Portfolio Algorithm (CRP)}
\usage{
alg_CRP(returns, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{returns}{Matrix of price relatives, i.e., the ratio of the closing
(opening) price today and the day before (use function
\code{get_price_relatives} to calculate from asset prices).}

\item{weights}{vector containing portfolio weights}
}
\value{
Object of class OLP containing
        \item{Alg}{Name of the Algorithm}
        \item{Names}{vector of asset names in the portfolio}
        \item{Weights}{calculated portfolio weights as a vector}
        \item{Wealth}{wealth achieved by the portfolio as a vector}
        \item{GrowthRate}{exponential growth rate achieved by the portfolio as a vector}
        \item{Return}{annualized portfolio return (252 trading days)}
        \item{Risk}{portfolio risk defined as the annualized standard deviation of returns (252 trading days)}
        \item{APY}{annualized percantage yield (252 trading days)}
        \item{MDD}{maximum draw down (downside risk)}

\description{
computes the constant rebalanced portfolio algorithm (CRP)
}
\note{
The print method for \code{OLP} objects prints only a short summary.

returns = cbind(comme=NYSE$comme, kinar=NYSE$kinar)
weights = c(0.5, 0.5)

# compute Constant Rebalanced Portfolio
CRP = alg_CRP(returns, weights); CRP
