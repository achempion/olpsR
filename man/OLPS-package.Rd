\title{OLPS: Functions for Online Portfolio Selection.}
\description{
The OLPS package provides different online portfolio selection algorithms
and functions to deal with the online portfolio selection problem.
Datasets to test the algorithms are also included.
}
\section{Algorithms}{

The following online portfolio selection algorithms are currently implemented:
\itemize{
 \item{\code{BH}: }{Buy-and-Hold}
 \item{\code{BHbest}: }{best Buy-and-Hold}
 \item{\code{CRP}: }{Constant Rebalanced Portfolio}
 \item{\code{BCRP}: }{Best Constant Rebalanced Portfolio}
 \item{\code{UP}: }{Universal Portfolio}
 \item{\code{EG}: }{Exponential Gradient}
 \item{\code{Anticor}: }{Anticor}
 \item{\code{PAMR}: }{Passive Aggressive Mean Reversion}
 \item{\code{VT}: }{Volatility Timing}
}
For more details on the algorithms please refer to the paper
"Online Portfolio Selection: A Survey"

}

\section{Functions}{

'Helper' functions, e.g. to transform stock prices into price relatives or
into a Kelly market sequence.
}

\section{Datasets}{

Historical stock prices for different markets.
